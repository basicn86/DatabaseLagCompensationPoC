# Database Lag Compensation Proof of Concept
## About
Welcome to the database lag compensation proof of concept repository! This proof of concept demonstrates an approach to mitigating latency in database operations. By implementing a caching mechanism, this demo enables clients to preview updated values before they are officially committed to the server. The lag compensation technique utilized here optimizes the user experience by minimizing the impact of network delays, providing a smoother and more responsive user interface.
## Key Features
* **Cache-based Data Retrieval:** Experience reduced latency as data is retrieved from a local cache before querying the database. This technique provides a faster user experience by minimizing the need for repeated server requests.
* **Asynchronous Updates:** Values are updated in the local cache before being committed to the database through asynchronous network requests. This approach allows users to see their modifications instantaneously, creating a fast and responsive user interface.
* **Lag Resistance:** By prioritizing local caching and asynchronous updates, this proof of concept showcases a resilient system that remains responsive even in the challenges of network delays.
## The Problem
Network delays can significantly impact the responsiveness of user interfaces, leading to suboptimal user experiences. An illustration of this challenge arises when users initiate updates, which involves sending requests to update the database and subsequently retrieving the updated data. This long process introduces noticeable delays, hindering the perception of real-time responsiveness to the user.

The typical workflow involves synchronous interaction with the database, where changes made by the user are committed first before any feedback is provided. As a result, users often experience lag between their actions and the reflection of those actions in the user interface, therefore degrading the overall quality of the application.
